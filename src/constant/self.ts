  about: [
    "Hey there! I’m an aspiring software engineer with a knack for turning curiosity into code. My journey into tech started with simple “how does this work?” moments—and before I knew it, I was diving deep into the worlds of machine learning, computer networking, and Android development.",
    "I’m fascinated by how machines talk, learn, and make decisions. These days, I spend more time understanding network flows and tinkering with ML ideas—chasing the little aha! moments that keep me hooked on engineering.",
    "I'm currently on a quest to understand intelligent systems and large-scale data flow. When I'm not coding, I'm probably drawing network diagrams on a whiteboard, reading ML papers I barely understand (yet!), or trying to automate my own life. I love building things that aren't just functional, but smart and scalable.",
